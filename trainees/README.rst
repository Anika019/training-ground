Trainees can add files to this directory in their own fork's feature branches
and then open pull requests.

For example, a new file named ``hello_nnn.txt``, where ``nnn`` is a number
that is not taken yet. Within the file, trainee can simply type::

    Hello world!

Changed -- for rebasing purposes!
